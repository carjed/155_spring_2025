    "text": "Follow these instructions to set up the software that we’ll be using throughout the semester. Even if you’ve already downloaded both R and RStudio, you’ll want to re-download to make sure that you have the most current versions.\n\nRequired: Change the default file download location for your internet browser.\n\nGenerally by default, internet browsers automatically save all files to the Downloads folder on your computer. This does not encourage good file organization practices. You need to change this option so that your browser asks you where to save each file before downloading it.\nThis page has information on how to do this for the most common browsers.\n\n\nRequired: Download R and RStudio.\n\nFIRST: Download R here.\n\nIn the top section, you will see three links “Download R for …”\nChoose the link that corresponds to your computer.\nAs of August 27, 2024, the latest version of R is 4.4.1 (“Race for Your Life”).\n\nSECOND: Download RStudio here.\n\nClick the button under step 2 to install the version of RStudio recommended for your computer.\nAs of August 27, 2024, the latest version of RStudio is 2024.04.2+764.\n\n\n\nSuggested: Watch this video describing key configuration options for RStudio.\n\nRequired: Install required packages.\n\nAn R package is an extra bit of functionality that will help us in our data analysis efforts in a variety of ways.\nOpen RStudio and click inside the Console pane (by default, the bottom left pane). Copy and paste the following command into the Console. You should see the text below appear to the right of the &gt;, which is called the R prompt. After you paste, hit Enter.\n\n\ninstall.packages(c(\"tidyverse\"))\n\n\nYou will see a lot of text from status messages appearing in the Console as the packages are being installed. Wait until you see the &gt; again.\nEnter the command library(tidyverse) and hit Enter.\nIf you see an error message, then there was a problem installing the package. Talk to the instructor or a preceptor for help.\nQuit RStudio. You’re done setting up!\n\n\nOptional: For a tour of RStudio features, watch this video. It also shows you how to customize the layout and color scheme of RStudio.\n\nRequired: Set essential RStudio options.\nGo to Tools -&gt; Global Options -&gt; General -&gt; Workplace. You’ll see 2 options:\n\nRestore .RData into workspace at startup: Leave this unchecked\nSave workspace to .RData on exit: Select “Never”\n\nWithout doing this RStudio will save and reload everything that you’ve been working on from the start of the semester. Since we’ll be working with new data each class, we want to keep our digital environment clean. Essentially, this is like an artist getting a clean canvas for each new painting rather than trying to paint all paintings on a single canvas."

The survey will be sent out early in the semester (exact date TBD) and will allow you to either list people you would like to be in a group with or specify that you would like to be placed in a group randomly by me. I will do my best to ensure that groups are constructed as closely to survey responses as possible. Since one component of the project involves an in-class presentation, you may not work with students in different sections on the project.\nIf for any reason there is an individual (or individuals) with whom you do not feel safe participating in a project group with, there will be a space to note this on the survey. You will not be expected to provide any justification for your response to this question, but note that as I need to place you in groups, the survey will not be anonymous.\nGroup work and collaboration are important components of nearly all statistical analyses and projects. I recognize that individual contributions to a group project are not always consistent between group members. To this end, you will (as a group) be expected to explicitly specify the project tasks completed by each team member along with the final draft of your paper.\nIf there are any concerns with project groups throughout the semester, I am happy to meet with groups or individuals to discuss ways to move forward."

All MSCS courses will also share a dedicated R preceptor (Kyle Suelflow), who can help with any issues you have with your R code or RStudio configuration. The course Moodle site contains detailed information for preceptor office hour times/locations.\nThe role of an MSCS preceptor is to help students with content questions, assist in the navigation of available resources, advise on studying approaches for classes, and assist with concepts, tools, and skills needed for problem sets. Students are accountable for their own learning; as such, preceptors are not allowed to share answers to assignments (unless specifically directed by the instructor), are not expected to immediately know the right approach, or provide assistance outside of office hours. Guidelines and expectations on how to interact with preceptors can be found here.\nIn addition, the Macalester Academic Excellence (MAX) Center provides tutoring for STAT 155.

Will cover material from the first quiz to some extent because of the way that material in this course builds on earlier ideas.\nQuiz 3: Final exam period. The quiz will be written to take 1.25 hours, but you will have the full two hour period to complete it. Will cover content from the whole course.\nSection 02: Fri. 5/9 8:00am-10:00am\nSection 03: Thurs. 5/8 1:30pm-3:30pm\nSection 04: Sat. 5/10 10:30am-12:30pm\n\nEach quiz question will be graded on the following scale:\n\n3 points: fully correct\n2 points: mostly correct with minor errors\n1 point: missing key understanding\n0 points: fully off target or blank\n\nQuiz format:\n\nFully pen/pencil and paper. You will not need to write code or use a calculator, but you will need to be able to read and interpret output from R code.\nYou are allowed to bring a 3x5 index card with notes written on both sides. Typing your notes and pasting them on the card is fine.\n\nShowing growth: You can earn up to 50% of missed points back on quizzes if you submit a quiz correction and reflection. You must:\n\nWrite a reflection of how you prepared for the quiz and where you felt strongest and more uncertain in your understanding before taking the quiz.\nSubmit your quiz corrections along with your reflection to the instructor, no later than one week after quizzes have been handed back.\n\nYou will not have the option to earn points back on the third quiz, due to time constraints at the end of the semester, so I encourage you to make use of this opportunity early on!\n\n\nPractice problems\nThere will be 8 practice problems throughout the course, building off of topics learned in videos/our in-class activities. Practice problems will be due on Wednesdays at 5pm. You are encouraged to work together on practice problems, but the work that you submit, including code, should be your own.\nYou will receive qualitative feedback on all questions on these practice problem sets. Each question (or occasionally, parts of a question) will receive an overall score on the following scale:\n\nHigh pass: 2 points\nPass: 1 point\nNeeds improvement: 0 points\n\nShowing growth: If, on a quiz, you demonstrate stronger understanding of the concepts you missed on a practice problem, you have the chance to earn points back on up to two questions on a single practice problem. Similarly to quiz corrections, you must:\n\nWrite a reflection of how the practice problem went for you, and where you felt strongest and more uncertain in your understanding before submitting the assignment.\nDemonstrate an improved understanding of the concepts on the practice problem that you missed, referencing specific questions you answered correctly on the quiz.\nSubmit your practice problem corrections along with your reflection to the instructor, no later than one week after quizzes have been handed back.\n\nYou can do this 2 times over the semester (once for each of the first two quizzes), and you can show improvement on multiple practice problems using a single quiz. You cannot do this on the third quiz, due to time constraints at the end of the semester.\n\n\nGroup Project\nThe goal of the course project is to apply the data analysis skills from our course to investigate a research question in a dataset of your choosing. Through milestones over the course of the semester, you will make steady progress on your projects and iterate on feedback. Full details about the project will be available on the Project page.\n\n\nCheckpoints\nSome class periods will have readings and/or videos assigned ahead of time. For these classes, there will be a short multiple-choice Moodle checkpoint, due by the end of the day. I strongly encourage you to complete the checkpoints before class, but you have the option to complete them after class if you find that doing so helps you review & retain the material better.\nThese short quizzes are designed to ensure that you stay on top of course material, since we move very quickly and much of the content in this course builds on itself.\nCheckpoint quizzes are graded for completion. If you complete 80% of the checkpoint quizzes before the time they are due, your overall course grade will not be negatively affected. If you complete less than 80% of the checkpoint quizzes before the time they are due, your overall course grade will be lowered by 1/3 of a letter grade (i.e. B → B-, A- → B+, etc.)."

The purpose of deadlines (and extensions) are to keep you accountable for your own learning, to keep you on track with the pace of the course (which builds upon itself throughout the semester), and to provide preceptors and myself with the ability to provide you with timely feedback on assignments. Since the Problem Sets are due roughly every two weeks, you must begin working on them early if you want to succeed.\nExtensions can be used automatically, without letting me know in advance. The Moodle dropboxes for assignments will close exactly 3 days after the original deadline (i.e. Saturdays at 5pm), and I will not accept work submitted after that point unless there are extenuating circumstances that you have communicated with me about ahead of the original deadline. If you email me a completed assignment after a 3-day extension is up, I may have the preceptors provide you with feedback, but you will not receive credit for the assignment (equivalent to “Needs Improvement” on every question of the relevant assignment).\nI expect you to keep track of how many extensions you’ve used. I will do my best to email you a reminder if you have used all three of your extensions and have none remaining.\nIf you have run out of extensions and/or an extenuating circumstance occurs that impacts your ability to submit assignments on time, please email me to discuss the situation.

    "text": "Artificial Intelligence (AI) Use\nIn this course, I strongly discourage the use of generative AI tools (ChatGPT, Google Gemini, Claude, etc.), for three main reasons:\n\nWe are learning the essentials of a new language and way of thinking. Learning how to do something the “long” or “hard” way is beneficial not only for developing critical thinking skills, but because that process can be enriching and fulfilling in its own right. Though AI can (sometimes) put access to answers at your fingertips, it cannot replace the physical, sensory, and emotional experience of sketching out ideas on a whiteboard with friends, stopping by your professor’s office for a donut, or the satisfaction of knowing that you can do something hard from scratch.\nI care much more about developing your ability to identify interesting problems, iteratively seek a solution, and convince the world that your solution works than I do about your ability to find answers that are already known (using AI or otherwise). Remember that “generative” AI is only capable of remixing existing information—it cannot create new knowledge, situate that knowledge in the context of your lived experience, or apply that knowledge to instigate change.\nIn this course, I hope to emphasize the importance of process over output. Consider an analogy of a painting class at Macalester. You’re a novice painter, but you have a strong point of view and a solid understanding of context and tradition, so you decide to write an AI prompt to generate the artwork and translate it to physical media. After lots of wordsmithing and iterations on Midjourney, your AI-generated image ready. It’s provocative and beautiful…it will look even better on canvas! You get to work, admiring yourself for finishing faster than your classmates because you knew exactly what your final product would look like. You step back to admire your masterpiece, and realize it’s at best a paint-by-numbers, and at worst, complete garbage because you were so focused on crafting the perfect AI prompt that you didn’t really learn how to mix colors or use different brush techniques.\n\nAll of that being said, I have neither the time nor interest in policing the use of AI tools. If you do choose to use AI, any ideas, language, or code that is produced by AI must be cited, just like any other resource.\n\nHow to cite AI: If you have used AI in any assignment, please include a paragraph at the end explaining what you used the AI for and what prompts you used to get the results. Failure to do so is in violation of the academic integrity policy at Macalester College."

I have no tolerance for discrimination of any kind, in and out of the classroom. If you are seeking campus resources regarding discrimination, the Department of Multicultural Life and the Center for Religious and Spiritual Life are wonderful resources. We will also respect the MSCS Community Guidelines.\nSensitive Topics: Applications in this course span issues in science, policy, and society. As such, we may sometimes address sensitive topics. I will try to announce in class if an assignment or activity involves a potentially sensitive topic. If you have reservations about a particular topic, please come talk to me to discuss possible options.\nAccommodations: If you need accommodations for any reason, please contact Disability Services to discuss your needs, and speak with me as soon as possible afterwards so that we can discuss your accommodation plan. If you already have official accommodations, please discuss these with me within the first week of class so that you get off to a great start. Contact me if you have other special circumstances. I will find resources for you.\nTitle IX: You deserve a community free from discrimination, sexual harassment, hostility, sexual assault, domestic violence, dating violence, and stalking. If you or anyone you know has experienced harassment or discrimination, know that you are not alone. Macalester provides staff and resources to help you find support. Please be aware that as a faculty member, it is my responsibility to report disclosure about sexual harassment, sexual misconduct, relationship violence, and stalking to the Title IX Office. The purpose of this report is to ensure that anyone experiencing harm receives the resources and support they need. I will keep this information private, and it will not be shared beyond this required report.\nYou may also contact Macalester’s Title IX Coordinator directly (phone: 651-696-6258; e-mail: titleixcordinator@macalester.edu); they will provide you with supportive measures, resources, and referrals. Additional information about how to file a report (including anonymously) is available on the Title IX website.\nGeneral Health and Well-being: I care that you prioritize your well-being in this semester and beyond. Investing time into taking care of yourself will have profound impacts on all aspects of your life. Remember that beyond being a student, you are a human being carrying your own experiences, thoughts, emotions, and identities. It is important to acknowledge any stressors you may be facing, which can be mental, emotional, physical, cultural, financial, etc., and how they can have an impact on you. I encourage you to remember that you have a body with needs. In the classroom, eat when you are hungry, drink water, use the restroom, and step out if you are upset and need some air. Please do what is necessary so long as it does not impede your or others’ ability to be mentally and emotionally present in the course. Outside of the classroom, sleeping well, moving your body, and connecting with others can be strategies can help nourish you. If you are having difficulties maintaining your well-being, please don’t hesitate to contact me and/or find support from physical and mental health resources here, here, and here."

Many of the earliest statisticians in the 19th and 20th centuries used and abused statistics to justify colonialism, ableism, classism, sexism, eugenics, and white supremacy.\nOn top of this problematic history, cultural norms around academic performance in quantitative disciplines can make courses like this one feel intimidating and exclusionary, rather than collaborative and interdisciplinary.\nTo counter these barriers, my central goal as an instructor is to intentionally foster community and connectedness. I believe that your unique voices and perspectives in this class will enrich our collective learning process and, in turn, your college experience. I encourage you to get to know your classmates (and me!) beyond a superficial familiarity and connect over our shared interests, identities, and ideas. You can help cultivate that community by being thoughtful about the way you engage with others and stretching your comfort zone to interact with people who are outside of your established social circles."

Like in all aspects of life, trust in scientific claims must be earned.\nIn this course and beyond, I encourage you to approach any statistical results you encounter with a healthy skepticism, informed by both your gut intuition and the material you’ve learned.
